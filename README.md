Step 2: Configure Authentication

    OAuth Setup
        Set up a GitHub OAuth app and configure Supabase to use it.

    Vercel Environment Variables
        Add NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL in Vercel settings.

Step 3: Database Initialization

    Run SQL Migrations
        If not set up automatically, navigate to the SQL Editor and execute the contents of the schema.sql file.

Step 4: Set Up Supabase Environment Variables

    Manual Setup
        Copy Supabase project API keys and URL into Vercel as NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL.

Step 5: Configure Stripe
